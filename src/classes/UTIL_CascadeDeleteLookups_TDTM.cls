 * @description Trigger handler allowing cascade delete and undelete of child objects through lookup relationships.
 * The only difference in functionality with standard cascade deletion is that child records show up separately from
 * their parent in the recycle bin.
 * To enable cascade delete for a new relationship, add it to the "cascades" map. When adding a new object type, also
 * add a corresponding trigger handler.
 * NOTE: Since standard cascade deletes don't run triggers on deleted children, records in the "cascades" map can also
 * be created for children further down the chain, e.g. grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc. The relationship to 
 * the deleted parent object can be provided to allow cascade functionality for those parent objects.
